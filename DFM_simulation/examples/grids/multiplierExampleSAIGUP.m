%% Effects of Transmissibility Multipliers
% Consider once more the incompressible, immiscible two-phase pressure
% equation
%
% $$\nabla\cdot v = q, \qquad v=\textbf{--}\lambda K\nabla p$$
%
% One approach to modelling conduits and barriers to flow is to introduce
% scalar multipliers on the transmissiblity of a set of grid block
% connections (cell interfaces).  While historically strongly tied to the
% application of a particular discretisation method (the two-point flux
% approximation), recent development has demonstrated how to incorporate
% such multipliers into other consistent and convergent discretisation
% schemes such as the mimtic method.
%
% Here we illustrate effects of transmissibility mulipliers on the
% qualitative behaviour of the solution of the above problem.  Moreover, we
% demonstrate how the practitioner may introduce multiplier effects in the
% mimetic method as implemented in MRST.

% The model can be downloaded from the the MRST page

if ~exist(grdecl, 'file'),
   error('SAIGUP model data is not available.')
end

%% Read model data and convert units
%
% The model data is provided as an ECLIPSE input file that can be read
% using the <matlab:doc('readGRDECL') readGRDECL> function.
grdecl = readGRDECL(grdecl);

%%
% MRST uses the strict SI conventions in all of its internal calculations.
% The SAIGUP model, however, is provided using the ECLIPSE 'METRIC'
% conventions (permeabilities in mD and so on).  We use the functions
% <matlab:doc('getUnitSystem') getUnitSystem> and
% <matlab:doc('convertInputUnits') convertInputUnits> to assist in
% converting the input data to MRST's internal unit conventions.
usys   = getUnitSystem('METRIC');
grdecl = convertInputUnits(grdecl, usys);

%% Define geometry and rock properties
% We generate a space-filling geometry using the
% <matlab:doc('processGRDECL') processGRDECL> function and then compute a
% few geometric primitives (cell volumes, centroids, etc.) by means of the
% <matlab:doc('computeGeometry') computeGeometry> function.
G = processGRDECL  (grdecl);
G = computeGeometry(G);

%%
% The media (rock) properties can be extracted by means of the
% <matlab:doc('grdecl2Rock') grdecl2Rock> function.  This function inspects
% the keywords present in the input data and constructs a |rock| data
% structure that holds the permeability tensor $K$ (in the structure
% field |perm|), possibly porosity values $\phi$ (in the |poro| field).
%
% The first input argument is the raw input data as constructed by function
% |readGRDECL|.  The second, optional, input argument is a list of active
% cells represented as a mapping from the grid's cells to the global grid
% cells from the original Nx-by-Ny-by-Nz box description.
rock = grdecl2Rock(grdecl, G.cells.indexMap);

%% Modify the permeability to avoid singular tensors
% MRST, or rather the mimetic method implemented in MRST, requires a
% positive definite permeability tensor in all active grid blocks.  The
% input data of the SAIGUP realisation, however has zero vertical
% permeability in a number of cells.  We work around this issue by
% (arbitrarily) assigning the minimum positive vertical (cross-layer)
% permeability to the grid blocks that have zero cross-layer permeability.
%
% We do emphasise that the above restriction does mean that the mimetic
% method currently implemented in MRST is not capable of handling fully
% sealing barriers, at least if those barriers are represented as zero
% grid block permeability.
is_pos                = rock.perm(:, 3) > 0;
rock.perm(~is_pos, 3) = min(rock.perm(is_pos, 3));

%% Extract multipliers from the input data
% The <matlab:doc('computeTranMult') computeTranMult> function, new in MRST
% release 2011a, extracts multiplier data from input, typically represented
% by the ECLIPSE keywords |MULTX|, |MULTY| or |MULTZ|, and computes a
% scalar multiplier value (default |1.0|) for each reservoir connection.
% The result, |m|, is represented as a scalar for each face for each
% grid block, with internal faces being represented twice.
%
% In a sense, the |computeTranMult| function plays a r√¥le similar to the
% |grdecl2Rock| function that extracts and reshapes permeability data from
% the input model information.
m = computeTranMult(G, grdecl);

%% Inspect multiplier structure
% The multiplier data |m| is provided once for each face in each grid cell,
% meaning internal faces are represented twice.  However, we need one value
% per unique face (connection) when we're plotting this data.  Fortunately,
% the |computeTranMult| function computes a symmetric assignment, so we
% need only extract the last multiplier value pertaining to any particular
% face.  This is accomplished by indexing into the (smaller) result array
% |mface| with the cell-to-face mapping and then doing regular assignment.
mface                     = zeros([G.faces.num, 1]);
mface(G.cells.faces(:,1)) = m;

% We display the grid structure as a background and add some transparency
% to the graphics so as not to obscure the multiplier data.  Moreover, we
% only display the multipliers that introduce barriers, i.e., the
% multipliers that are less than unity.  To accentuate the structure of
% this data, we plot the logarithm of the actual multiplier values.

%
% First we construct the injection and production wells using the
% |'ip_quasirt'| inner product.  This inner product is applicable to the

%
% We place the injector in an area of the model that is mostly boxed in by
% the fault structure, so we expect the faults to significantly affect the
% resulting reservoir flows.  Moreover, the producer is in an area that is
% also mostly shielded from the remainder of the reservoir.

%% Calculate face transmissibilites
% In this problem we consider only barriers to flow.  These manifest as
% transmissibility multipliers less than unity.  Selecting multipliers less
% than $10^{\textbf{--} 3}$ we pick out those multipliers whose effect on
% the overall solution will be the most distinctive.
%
% An upcoming paper in the SPE Journal shows that multipliers can be
% incorporated into the mimetic method by computing an associated face
% transmissibility and subsequently modifying the mimetic inner product
% using this transmissibility.  In particular, if the connection (face)
% between cells |i| and |j| is affected by a multiplier $m \in (0,1)$, then
% we may add a diagonal contribution of
%
% $$\mathsf{T}_{ij} \, \frac{m}{1\textbf{--} m} $$
%
% to the corresponding term in the mimetic inner product in cells |i| and
% |j|, respectively.
%
% Here we incorporate the synthetic fault transmissibilities defined above
% into the actual multiplier data defined in the input, compute the face
% transmissibilities $\mathsf{T}_{ij}$ (result |ftrans|) and the multiplier
% update outlined above (result |facetrans|). Function |computeMimeticIP|
% will then incorporate these values into the pertinent inner products.
m = m .* fault_mult;
i = m < 1e-3;
T = computeTrans(G, rock);

ftrans    = 1 ./ accumarray(G.cells.faces(:,1), 1 ./ T);
facetrans = ftrans(G.cells.faces(i,1)) .* (m(i) ./ (1 - m(i)));

%%
% We now calculate the mimetic inner product with and without explicit face
% transmissibility.  Note that we employ the |'ip_quasirt'| inner product
% when constructing the discretisations.  This is consistent with the well
% object defined above.
%
% The <matlab:doc('double') |double|> type conversion of the cell-to-face
% mapping in the first column of the |'FaceTrans'| option argument is
% needed to work around a type compatibility issue between the
% |processGRDECL| and the <matlab:doc('computeMimeticIP') computeMimeticIP>
% function.  In particular, the former generates a cell-to-face mapping of
% type <matlab:doc('int32') |int32|> to conserve memory while the latter
% expects that the |'FaceTrans'| option argument is a |double| array, the
% first column of which contains integral indices.  During mixed-type array
% operations involving integer classes, however, the MATLAB(R) software
% chooses a result type that matches the integer class.
