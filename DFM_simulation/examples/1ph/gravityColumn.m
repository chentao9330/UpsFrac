%% My First Flow Solver: Gravity Column
% In this example, we introduce a simple pressure solver and use it to
% solve the single-phase pressure equation
%
% $$\nabla\cdot v = q, \qquad
%    v=\textbf{--}\frac{K}{\mu} \bigl[\nabla p+\rho g\nabla z\bigr],$$
%
% within the domain [0,1]x[0,1]x[0,30] using a Cartesian grid with
% homogeneous isotropic permeability of 100 mD. The fluid has density 1000
% kg/m^3 and viscosity 1 cP and the pressure is 100 bar at the top of the
% structure.
%
% The purpose of the example is to show the basic steps for setting up,
% solving, and visualizing a flow problem. More details on the grid
% structure, the structure used to hold the solutions, and so on, are given
% in the <simpleBC.html basic flow-solver tutorial>.

%% Define the model
% To set up a model, we need: a grid, rock properties (permeability), a
% fluid object with density and viscosity, and boundary conditions.
gravity reset on
G          = cartGrid([1, 1, 30], [1, 1, 30]);
G          = computeGeometry(G);
rock.perm  = repmat(0.1*darcy(), [G.cells.num, 1]);
fluid      = initSingleFluid('mu' ,    1*centi*poise, ...
                             'rho', 1014*kilogram/meter^3);
bc  = pside([], G, 'TOP', 100.*barsa());

%% Assemble and solve the linear system
% To solve the flow problem, we use the standard two-point
% flux-approximation method (TPFA), which for a Cartesian grid is the same
% as a classical seven-point finite-difference scheme for Poisson's
% equation. This is done in two steps: first we compute the
% transmissibilities and then we assemble and solve the corresponding
% discrete system.
T   = computeTrans(G, rock);
sol = incompTPFA(initResSol(G, 0.0), G, T, fluid, 'bc', bc);

%% Plot the face pressures

plotFaces(G, 1:G.faces.num, convertTo(sol.facePressure, barsa()));
