% different polymer cost as well as the total profit without polymer
% injection.

% While polymer injection is happening, the polymer value is lower than
% without polymer as there is an increased cost. Once the polymer injection
% phase is over, we reap the benefits and get an increased oil output
% resulting in a bigger total value for the reservoir lifetime.
