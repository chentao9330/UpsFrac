function WP = computeWellPairs(state, G, rock, W, D )
%Compute volumes and fluxes associated with each flux pair
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   WP = computeWellPairs(G, rock, W, D)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G     - Grid structure.
%
%   rock  - Rock data structure.
%           Must contain a valid porosity field, 'rock.poro'.
%
%   state - Reservoir and well solution structure either properly
%           initialized from functions 'initResSol' and 'initWellSol'
%           respectively, or the results from a call to function
%           'solveIncompFlow'.  Must contain valid cell interface fluxes,
%           'state.flux'.
%
%   W     - Well structure
%
%   D     - Struct containing TOF and tracer
%           See documentation of computeTOFandTracer
% RETURNS:
%   WP - struct containing well-pair diagnostics
%       'pairs'   - list of well pairs
%       'vols'    - pore volumes associated with each pair
