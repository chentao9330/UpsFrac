function partition2 = processPartition(G, partition, varargin)
%Split disconnected coarse blocks into new blocks.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   p2 = processPartition(G, p)
%   p2 = processPartition(G, p, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G       - Grid structure as described by grid_structure.
%
%   p       - Vector of size G.cells.num-by-1 of initial cell-to-block
%             mappings.  Assumed to be a vector of positive integers.  If
%             there are no non-connected coarse blocks, then ALL(p2 == p),
%             meaning the coarse blocks numbers are preserved for all
%             internally connected coarse blocks.
%
%   'pn'/pv - List of 'key'/value pairs designating optional parameters.
%             Currently supported parameters are
%               - Verbose   -- Whether or not to emit progress reports
%                              during the computation.
%                              Logical.  Default value dependent upon global
%                              verbose settings in function 'mrstVerbose'.
%
%               - Reconnect -- Whether or not to perform a 'reconnection'
%                              step in which cells that have not been
%                              assigned a new (coarse) block will be
%                              connected to the nearest block.
%                              Logical.  Default value: TRUE.
%
%                              If Reconnect==FALSE, (i.e., don't reconnect
%                              disconnected cells) each disconnected cell
%                              will be assigned a separate new block.
%
% RETURNS:
%   p2 - Updated partition with only connected coarse blocks.

   %     found in step 5 while taking care to preserve the original block
   %     number of the first (and, possibly, only) block (i.e., component).
   %     This ensures that the output partition equals the input partition
   %     if no coarse blocks must be split.  As a special case, array
   %     'blkNo' must be empty when nbc==0 to avoid triggering an assertion
   %     in 'rldecode'.  This condition occurs if coarse block 'b' contains
   %     a single cell.
