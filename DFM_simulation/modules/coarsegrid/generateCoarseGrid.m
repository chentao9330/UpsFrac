function cg = generateCoarseGrid(g, p, varargin)
%Form coarse grid from partition of fine-scale grid.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   CG = generateCoarseGrid(G, p)
%   CG = generateCoarseGrid(G, p, pf)
%
% PARAMETER:
%   G - grid_structure data structure describing fine-scale discretisation
%       of reservoir geometry.
%
%   p - Partition vector of size [G.cells.num, 1] describing the coarse
%       grid.  We assume that all coarse blocks are connected.  The
%       partition vector is often created by function partitionCartGrid
%       or function partitionUI.
%
%   pf - Partition vector on faces of 'G'. This indicator enables
%        construction of coarse grids with multiple connections between
%        coarse block pairs.  OPTIONAL.  Default value (unset) corresponds
%        to generating coarse faces defined by unique block pairs only.
%
% RETURNS:
%   CG - Coarse grid structure.  The coarse grid consists entirely of
%        topological information stored in the same topological fields as
%        in the fine-scale grid described in 'grid_structure'.
%
%        Specifically, the fields
%
%            CG.cells.num, CG.cells.facePos, CG.cells.faces
%            CG.faces.num, and CG.faces.neighbors
%
%        have the same interpretation in the coarse grid as in the
%        fine-scale grid.
%
%        The partition vector 'p' is stored within the coarse grid in a
%        separate field, 'CG.partition'.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   coarseConnections, transposeConnections, grid_structure.
