# UpsFrac
A modeling and upscaling software for two-dimensional fractured porous rocks.


>>> Perform DFM modeling using the ADFNE framework in the DFM_modeling folder.


>>> Subdivide the fractures into Cartesian grid blocks.


>>> Create input files for DFM simulations within Cartesian grid blocks.


>>> Conduct DFM simulations using the MRST framework in the DFM_simulation folder.


>>> Calculate the equivalent permeability (keq) for all Cartesian grid blocks.


>>> Visualize the equivalent permeability (keq).
